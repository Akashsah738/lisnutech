      <p class="para1">What is Inbound Marketing?
        Inbound Marketing is a new Digital Marketing philosophy designed to help companies be found by potential customers. Over the last decade, it is considered to be one of the most effective online marketing methods. The goal is usable content during the web design process that pulls the audience towards your company via Video, Infographics, Blogging, ebooks, photos and more. Content should meet the needs of prospective customers and answer basic questions and queries. The ultimate goal of Inbound Marketing is to convert unidentified internet users to customers and promoters of our company.
        
        The first thing that differentiates Inbound Marketing from Classic Business Marketing is that it includes tactics that gain our attention rather than become annoying. While surfing the web, using social media, or using our mobile, all of the classic methods interrupt our online journey and try to get our attention. In this way, they just manage to irritate the user. Techniques such as Pop-ups paid email lists and customer contact calls are now outdated and with reduced performance. This is mainly due to the huge volume of advertising that bombs consumers daily.
        
        Inbound Marketing steps
        
        Attract Visitors
        Customer engagement begins when the prospective audience searches for information, products, or services. What you need to do is allow him to find your business. Some ways are the Search Engine Optimization (SEO), that is the ranking of your website on Google. Prospective customers begin the process of buying or finding services by searching on Google’s search engine. This is the reason you need to make sure you appear at the top of the list of results. An SEO Agency is the best way to go for this part!
        
        Some other ways are Social Media and Posts with useful content. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media help us share useful information, giving a familiar face to our company. But simple traffic to our site is unfortunately not enough to have a good number of sales and customers. So we have to go to the next step…
        
        Visitors into Leads
        Let us assume that the visitor first comes to our site and knows nothing about our business. The goal now is to become a prospective customer. Some ways to go to this stage are sign-ups, free E-books etc. 
        
        Leads into customers
        We are on the right track, but now is the time to turn leads into customers. A targeted email marketing campaign with useful and interesting content will keep your company in the thought of your audience. Even if they were not ready to buy the first time they visited your website, you should be there when they need it. Several emails will build confidence in your company.
